# pivotal-ui-react
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pivotal-cf/pivotal-ui-react.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/pivotal-cf/pivotal-ui-react)

React components built on top of a Bootstrap-based styleguide

## Usage

To include pivotal-ui-react components in your own project:

1. `npm install pui-react-<component-name>`
1. Include the CSS manually from the [pivotal-ui git repo](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pivotal-ui/releases). Yes, we know this is sub-optimal, we're working on it. ;)
    NB: You will need to be part of the Pivotal CF Github organization to download Pivotal UI. If you do not have access, email ask+cf@pivotal.io.
1. The components have a umd wrapper and can be loaded using any of the standard methods. We test them using CommonJS style (`require('pui-react-<component-name>')`) loaded with [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/).

## Dependencies

PUI-react uses the CommonJS pattern of requiring modules to use components.
To load the components for use in a browser, you will need a build tool like Webpack or Browserify.
We also require ReactJS. The specific version is listed in our peer dependencies.

For development, we have dependencies on:

* **PhantomJS**: Used for running our headless Jasmine tests. Install via `brew install phantomjs`
* **node-foreman**: Used for running our asset-compilation and jasmine server during development. Install via `npm install -g node-foreman`

## Development

This library is intimately tied to Pivotal UI and development should be done on the Pivotal UI [styleguide](styleguide.pivotal.io).

To develop react components:

The first time you create a component in `src/<component-name>` 

```sh
gulp build
```
This will create a distribution folder for you with a package.json and transpiled JavaScript.

While developing the component, run in the background
```sh
gulp foreman
```

This will keep your built JavaScript up-to-date and launch a Jasmine server on port 8888.

To use your component in Pivotal UI, in root of your `pivotal-ui` directory, type

```sh
npm link ../path/to/pivotal-ui-react/dist/component-name
```

For example, if `pivotal-ui` and `pivotal-ui-react` are both in the same parent directory, you can link in the tooltip component with

```sh
npm link ../pivotal-ui-react/dist/tooltip
```

##Testing

To test the react components:
```sh
gulp jasmine-ci
```
